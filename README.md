# Hi there 👋

I am a software generalist/polyglot who enjoys working across the entire stack. You can find my profile on [https://marcobaldo.com/](https://marcobaldo.com/).

## Research

I recently went back to school to finish my MS in Computer Science, doing research on 🚗 `route choice behavior`, `driving navigation`, and `computer vision` techniques for assessing road comfort and safety. In my spare time, I tinker 🔧 with electronics, build hardware, and figure out further extensions to my thesis.

## Work

I previously worked in the consulting space, helping other startups build their products from 0-1 and 1-10 to acquisition. 🏦 In [@xendit](https://github.com/xendit), I worked under the CTO/COO on technical PMI, modernizing logging/observability, increasing release cadence/confidence, and general improvements to operational efficiency. I also built a zero-downtime multi-billion TPV disbursement product.

Currently, in [@reaphq](https://github.com/reaphq/), I support the Engineering Operations team, leading work on some of the core services and tools that underpin our products.
